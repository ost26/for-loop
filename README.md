learning how the counter works in a for loop and when it terminates from the for loop the value of a variable has been incremented if its variable++



thought x was 6 in the first iteration, but it isn't, since in the inner for loop the value of j goes up to 6 and then terminates from the j for loop because the condition says j<=5, but value of j is 6 now. this 6 gets added to the outer i loop which is 1 in the first run and hence 6+1= 7 and so x is 7 not 6.
